# Vibe coded tools for stuff

Sometimes you just need to generate some colors, or maybe you want to generate a random color palette. This is a simple tool that does just that.

Another time you want to count words in a text, or maybe you want to count the number of characters in a text. This tool does that too.

Yet another time, you want to see how much protein is in the complex with given Kd values. This tool can help you analyze that as well.

And then, there is a day you want to see a protein statistics table, or maybe you want to see a extinction coefficient table. This tool can help you with that too.

## Features

Mostly vibe coded tools for stuff, using technology I am not familiar with, so it might not be the best code ever, but it works. Tested with other tools that do similar things. Coded using Gemini Pro and OpenAI o3.
